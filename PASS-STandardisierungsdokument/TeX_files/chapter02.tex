\section{All Classes (95)}

\begin{itemize}
\item PASSProcessModelElement
\begin{itemize}
	\item BehaviorDescribingComponent \linebreak \textit{Group of PASS-Model components that describe aspects of the behavior of subjects}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Action \linebreak \textit{An Action is a grouping concept that groups a state with all its outgoing valid transitions}
		\item DataMappingFunction \linebreak \textit{Standard Format for DataMappingFunctions must be define: XML? OWL? JSON? 
		Definitions of the ability/need to write or read data to and from a subject's personal data storage.
		DataMappingFunctions are behavior describing components since they define what the subject is supposed to do (mapping and translating data)
		Mapping may be done during reception of message, where data is taken from the message/Business Object (BO) and mapped/put into the local data field.
		It may be done during sending of a message where data is taken from the local vault and put into a BO.
		Or it may occur during executing a do function, where it is used to define read(get) and write (set) functions for the local data.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item DataMappingIncomingToLocal \linebreak \textit{A DataMapping that specifies how data is mapped from an an external source (message, function call etc.) to a subject's private defined data space.}

		\end{itemize}
		\item FunctionSpecification \linebreak \textit{A function specification for state denotes \\ 
			Concept: Definitions of calls of (mostly technical) functions (e.g. Web-service, Scripts, Database access,) that are not part of the process model.\\
			Function Specifications are more than "Data Properties"? --> - If special function types (e.g. Defaults) are supposed to be reused, having them as explicit entities is a the better OWL-modeling choice.}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item CommunicationAct \linebreak \textit{A super class for specialized FunctionSpecification of communication acts (send and receive)}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item ReceiveFunction \linebreak \textit{Specifications/descriptions for Receive-Functions describe in detail what the subject carrier is supposed to do in a state.\\
				DefaultFunctionReceive1\_EnvoironmentChoice : present the surrounding execution environment with the given exit choices/conditions currently available depending on the current state of the subjects in-box. Waiting and not executing the receive action is an option.\\
				DefaultFunctionReceive2\_AutoReceiveEarliest: automatically execute the according activity with the highest priority as soon as possible. In contrast to DefaultFunctionReceive1, it is not an option to prolong the reception and wait e.g. for another message.}
				\item SendFunction \linebreak \textit{Comments have to be added}
			\end{itemize}
			\item DoFunction \linebreak \textit{Specifications or descriptions for Do-Functions describe in detail what the subject carrier is supposed to do in an according state.
			The default DoFunction\\ 1: present the surrounding execution environment with the given exit choices/conditions and receive choice of one exit option --> define its Condition to be fulfilled in order to go to the next according state.
			The default DoFunction \\2: execute automatic rule evaluation (see DoTransitionCondition - ToDo)
			More specialized Do-Function Specifications may contain Data mappings denoting what of a subjects internal local Data can and should be:\\
			a) read: in order to simply see it or in order to send it of to an external function (e.g. a web service)\\
			b) write: in order to write incoming Data from e.g. a web Service or user input, to the local data fault}

			\item ChoiceSegmentPath \linebreak \textit{ChoiceSegments are groups of defined ChoiceSegementPaths. The paths may contain any amount of states. However, those states may not reach out of the bounds of the ChoiceSegmentPath.The path may contain any amount of states but may those states may not reach out of the bounds of the choice segment path. Similar to an initial state of a behavior a choice segment path must have one determined initial state. A transition within a choice segment path must not have a target state that is not inside the same choice segment path.}

			\item StandardPASSState \linebreak \textit{A super class to the standard PASS states: Do, Receive and Send}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item DoState \linebreak \textit{The standard state in a PASS subject behavior diagram denoting an action or activity of the subject in itself.}
				\item ReceiveState \linebreak \textit{The standard state in a PASS subject behavior diagram denoting an receive action or rather the waiting for a receive possibility.}
				\item SendState \linebreak \textit{The standard state in a PASS subject behavior diagram denoting a send action}
			\end{itemize}
			\item StateReference \linebreak \textit{A state reference is a model component that is a reference to a state in another behavior. For most modeling aspects it is a normal state.}
		\end{itemize}
		\item Transition \linebreak \textit{An edge defines the transition between two states. A transition can be traversed if the outcome of the action of the state it originates from satisfies a certain exit condition specified by it's "Alternative}

				\begin{itemize}
					\item CalendarBasedReminderTransition \linebreak \textit{A reminder transition, for defining exit conditions measured in calendar years or months \\ Conditions are e.g.: reaching of (in model) preset calendar date (e.g. 1st of July) or the reoccurrence of a a long running frequency ("every Month", "2 times a year")"}

The definition of a business day depends on a subject's relevant or legal location}
					\item DayTimeTimerTransition \linebreak \textit{Timer Transitions, denoting time outs for the state they originate from. The condition for a timer transition is that a certain amount of time has passed since the state it originates from has been entered.\\ Day or Time Timers are measured in normal 24 hour days.

			\end{itemize}
			\item TransitionCondition \linebreak \textit{natives which in turn is given for a state. An alternative (to leave the state) is only a real alternative if the exit condition is fulfilled (technically: if that according function returns "true"). \\Note: Technically and during execution exit conditions belong to states. They define when it is allowed to leave that state. However, in PASS models exit conditions for states are defined and connected to the according transition edges. Therefore transition conditions are individual entities and not DataProperties.\\ The according matching must be done by the model execution environment.\\ By its existence, an edge/transition defines one possible follow up "state" for its state of origin. It is coupled with an "Exit Condition" that must be fulfilled in the originating state in order to leave the state.}

				\end {itemize}
				\item SendingFailedCondition \linebreak \textit{Comments have to be added}
				\item TimeTransitionCondition \linebreak \textit{A condition that is deemed 'true' and thus the according edge is gone, if: a surrounding execution system has deemed the time since entering the state and starting with the execution of the according action as too long (predefined by the outgoing edge) \\ A condition that is true if a certain time defined has passed since the state this condition belongs to has been entered. (This is the standard TimeOut Exit condition)}
